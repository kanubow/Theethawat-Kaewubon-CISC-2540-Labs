For lab 2, I did another simple project where I took three copies of the Godot logo sprite, and coded them such that they can move with user input. I used Godot's built-in input command of Input.is_button_pressed such that actions were assigned to the arrow keys to move the sprites up, down, left and right. I also exported a variable named "speed" which of course, controls how fast the sprite moves, as the program position += speed is being updated constantly to make this happen. Overall, I learned how you can program in Godot, how to be able to control sprites in Godot, and why exporting variables is so important in Godot.
